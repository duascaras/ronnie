# Ronnie

## Interpreter Written in Go

Created following the book "Writing an Interpreter in Go" by Thorsten Ball. I've made some modifications, such as changing the name from Monkey to Ronnie and other minor adjustments. I hope he doesn't mind.

## Dependencies

You need [Go](https://go.dev/dl/) to run the project.

To check if it is correctly installed, run:

```
go version
```

## Usage

To get started with using Ronnie, you can explore the examples provided in the `examples` folder. These examples demonstrate various features and capabilities of the language.

### Running Examples

1. After cloning  the repo, navigate to the `examples` folder.

2. Choose an example file to run.

3. Run the example using the Ronnie interpreter. For example:

    ```
    go run main.go
    ```
    ```
    Hello, User!
    This is Ronnie. Feel free to type in commands.
    >> examples\functions.ro  # or any other examples file
    ```


Feel free to create your own examples and modify the existing ones to explore different aspects of Ronnie. You can add your example files to the `examples` folder and follow the same steps above to run them.
